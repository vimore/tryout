Shaded libs
This project contains third party class in a shaded package.


Initial need has been raised by MefTLDNormalizedConstraint : a log-mef constraint helping to extract Top Level Domain if a valid dns domain is provided.
TLD relies a list on entries and is maintained by ICANN and is regularly updated. Guava provides InternetDomainName class extracting TLD and containing a serialized version of the TLD list which is updated once every one to three months.

In that case, why not just add last guava artifact as module of log-mef ? because an older (more or less 4 years old) version of the lib is used at hadoop layer and this version comes first when resolving class names. we want to use a recent TLD list !

Shaded-libs content deals initially with
    com.google.thirdparty.publicsuffix.PublicSuffixPatterns and related class translated to package com.securityx.shaded.google.thirdparty.publicsuffix
    com.google.common.net.InternetDomainName translated to package com.securityx.shaded.google.common.net

Tricks

For IDEA : you must prevent idea to look into  this project for sources, instead use the maven dependency. to do so :
Right-click on shaded-libs -> pom.xml in the project view in IntelliJ, choose "Maven" -> "Ignore Projects". Then do a "Maven" -> "Reimport" on the log-mef pom.xml.
